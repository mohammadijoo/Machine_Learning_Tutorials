    "\n",
    "This lesson focuses on how machine learning is used in practice: what problems it solves, how to translate business/engineering needs into ML tasks, and how to evaluate success beyond a single metric. You will build and evaluate several small, end‑to‑end examples across **classification**, **regression**, and **clustering**, using datasets from this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify common real‑world ML use cases and map them to tasks (classification, regression, ranking, clustering, anomaly detection, forecasting).\n",
    "- Translate a high‑level question into: data requirements, target definition, constraints, and a measurable notion of success.\n",
    "- Build baseline models quickly and evaluate them with appropriate metrics and cost considerations.\n",
    "- Recognize practical issues (data leakage, drift, calibration, monitoring, governance) that affect production performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notation (minimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data: $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, targets $y$ (labels).\n",
    "- Model: $f_\\theta(x)$ with parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "- Loss: $\\ell(y, \\hat{y})$.\n",
    "- **Expected risk** (what we wish to minimize):  \n",
    "  $$R(f) = \\mathbb{E}[\\ell(y, f(x))]$$\n",
    "- **Empirical risk** (what we can compute on samples):  \n",
    "  $$\\hat{R}(f) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\ell(y_i, f(x_i))$$\n",

    "## 5) Case study C — Clustering for segmentation / discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is commonly used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- customer segmentation (marketing personas)\n",
    "- operational grouping (devices with similar behavior)\n",
    "- de-duplication and data organization\n",
    "- exploration when labels are absent\n",
    "\n",
    "### What clustering can and cannot do\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is not “truth discovery” by default. In real environments you must also:\n",
    "\n",
    "- validate clusters qualitatively (domain review)\n",
    "- check stability (do clusters persist across time samples?)\n",
    "- translate clusters into action (different treatments, monitoring, messaging)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance and scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Most clustering methods rely on distances. If features are on different scales, distance is dominated by the largest‑scale feature. Therefore we often standardize:\n",
