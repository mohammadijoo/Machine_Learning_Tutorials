    "# Chapter 2 — Basics of Data and Preprocessing\n",
    "## Lesson 6: Feature Engineering Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is the disciplined craft of turning *raw signals* into *model-ready inputs* that express the structure of your problem. In tabular machine learning, this step is often where most of the performance, stability, and interpretability gains come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compact way to describe the idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw input: $x_{\\mathrm{raw}}$\n",
    "- Feature map: $\\phi(\\cdot)$\n",
    "- Model prediction: $$\\hat{y} = f_{\\theta}\\!\\left(\\phi(x_{\\mathrm{raw}})\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you ultimately use powerful learners, a well-designed $\\phi(\\cdot)$ can make learning easier, reduce the sample complexity, and prevent common failure modes (especially leakage).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn (practical outcomes)\n",
    "By the end of this lesson you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify which feature transformations change the *hypothesis class* (and therefore model capacity).\n",
    "2. Engineer numeric, categorical, datetime, text, and group-aggregate features with correct train/test hygiene.\n",
    "3. Detect and avoid leakage patterns that feature engineering can accidentally introduce.\n",
    "4. Build an end-to-end `scikit-learn` pipeline that keeps engineering steps reproducible and safe.\n",
    "5. Evaluate whether engineered features actually help (rather than just adding complexity).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate techniques on **multiple datasets** (classification + regression + mixed-type tabular) to practice choosing features rather than memorizing a single recipe.\n"

    "## 1) A mental model: features define what the model can represent\n",
    "\n",
    "When you choose a model family you choose a *hypothesis class*. But feature engineering can be just as important because it changes the “language” the model sees.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a linear model on engineered features is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = w^\\top \\phi(x) + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if $w$ is linear, $\\phi(\\cdot)$ can introduce nonlinearity through:\n",
    "- products ($x_1 x_2$),\n",
    "- ratios ($x_1/(x_2+\\epsilon)$),\n",
    "- polynomials ($x_1^2$),\n",
    "- piecewise bins (bucketized features),\n",
    "- logarithms ($\\log(1+x)$),\n",
    "- and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three practical questions to ask before engineering\n",
    "1. **What invariances should the model respect?** (e.g., scale invariance → ratios/logs)\n",
    "2. **What monotonic or structural relationships are plausible?** (e.g., increasing risk with dose)\n",
    "3. **Where is leakage likely to hide?** (e.g., post-outcome variables, “future” aggregates)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the notebook we will use these questions as a checklist while creating features.\n"

    "## 2) What makes a “good” engineered feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful engineered feature tends to satisfy at least one of these properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predictive**: it correlates with the target because it captures a causal proxy or a stable association.\n",
    "- **Stable**: it is not overly sensitive to noise, outliers, or rare categories.\n",
    "- **Computable at inference time**: you can compute it from information available when you actually deploy.\n",
    "- **Low leakage risk**: it does not sneak in post-outcome signals or aggregates that use future data.\n",
    "- **Low operational cost**: it is not fragile, expensive, or hard to maintain.\n",
    "- **Model-aligned**: it matches what your model family is good at (e.g., linear models like “linear-ish” relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical way to think: feature engineering is a negotiation between *domain structure* and *model bias*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of “model-aligned” feature choices\n",
    "- For linear / generalized linear models: log transforms, ratios, interactions, monotone re-parameterizations.\n",
    "- For trees: bins are less important, but missing indicators and meaningful splits can help.\n",
    "- For distance-based models (kNN, RBF kernels): scaling and “metric learning by features” is critical.\n",
    "- For naive Bayes / count models: counts, rates, and calibrated discretizations can simplify assumptions.\n"

    "## 3) Data we will use in this lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "To practice *feature choice*, we will touch multiple real-world-shaped tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Health / classification** (diabetes-style numeric measurements)\n",
    "- **E-commerce / regression** (diamonds with categorical quality attributes + numeric measurements)\n",
    "- **Housing / regression** (house prices with neighborhood structure)\n",
    "- **Geo + text** (fast food places with categories + latitude/longitude)\n",
    "- **Time series events** (earthquake timestamps)\n",
    "- **Marketplace listings** (group structure: neighborhoods, hosts)\n",
    "- **HR-style table** (salary with job titles)\n",
